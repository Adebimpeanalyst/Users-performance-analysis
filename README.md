# Learning platform users performance analysis

#### Introduction:
In online learning platforms, tracking user performance is crucial for understanding engagement, effectiveness and overall outcomes.
This project aims to analyze user performance data from a learning site using SQL to gain insights into users activity, including top-performing users, accuracy in submission snd total points earned. 
By leveraging SQL queries, we can efficiently extract, filter, and aggregate data to identify key performance metrics that help improve the learning experience.

#### Dataset Overview:
The dataset consists of information about user submissions for an online learning platform. Each submission includes:
- User ID
- Question ID
- Points Earned
- Submission Timestamp
- Username
This data allows you to analyze user performance in terms of correct and incorrect submissions, total points earned, and daily/weekly activity.

#### Analysis:
